# Appium Mobile Grid Example

## Getting Started

Assumptions:
  * You have AndroidStudios installed.
  * You have npm & Appium installed. https://www.npmjs.com/package/appium
  * You're running this on a mac. Though, this shouldn't be too different to run on other platforms.
  * You have Homebrew installed. http://brew.sh/
  * You have android emulators installed or connected devices with USB Debug enabled.

To set up:

* Ensure you running at least Ruby version 2.0 or above. You can check this by
  running:

  `ruby -v`

  If you have an older version of Ruby installed, consider using
  [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) for installing a newer version
  of Ruby.

* Install Bundler:

  `gem install bundler`

* Run bundle install:

  `bundle install`

* Install Allure Report: https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-cli

  `brew tap allure-framework/allure`
  
  `brew install allure-cli`

## Running Specs

* Start emulators or connect devices!

To run specs in parallel: 

  `rake android[parallel]`
 
To run specs distributed:

  `rake android[dist]`

To run specs on SauceLabs:
  * Goto saucelabs.com and signup.
  * Then add your SauceLabs environment variables.
  
  `export SAUCE_USERNAME=<user sauce user_id>`
  
  `export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<your sauce access key>`

  `rake android[parallel,sauce]` << "Will run tests tagged with :sauce in parallel"
  
  `rake android[dist,sauce]` << "Will run tests tagged with :sauce distributed"
   
Generate Allure report:

  `allure generate report output/allure/*`
  
  `allure report open`

Disclaimer:
  * This example was built quickly, so the code is not in the optimal state of dryness.
  * No page objects were used. The tests are soley for example purposes. :)
